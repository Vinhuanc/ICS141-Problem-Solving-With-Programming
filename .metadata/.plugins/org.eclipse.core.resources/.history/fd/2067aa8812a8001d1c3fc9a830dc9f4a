Failure to follow these instructions and to use good programming rules such as; 
adding a description at the beginning of the program, 
naming classes and variables properly,
 declaring and initialing variables with the correct data type,
  organizing the code in an easy to read structure, 
  adding appropriate comments to document the code, 
  reading in the required inputs and printing the accurate outputs, 
  will result in points deduction. All code must be error free and executable to receive points.

//		1. What are the similarities between a Class, Object and Method?
//			share same instance variables, behaviors, belongs to the same template
//		2. What are the differences between a Class, Object and Method?
//			class is the template, object is the instance of the class, methods are the actions
//		3. What is the importance of using a UML?
//			allows developers to visualize the project, gives method descriptions to developers without knowing the specific language
//		4. What happens when we add static to a method?
//			it will belong to the class, not the instance of the class
//		5. Can we instantiate an object if our class doesnâ€™t have a constructor? What does adding a constructor to a class do?
//			cannot instantiate object without constructor, adding a constructor allows the class to be instantiated.
//		6. How is a constructor different from a class?
//			a class is the template for instantiating the object, the constructor is the method to instantiate the object with parameters/characteristics.
